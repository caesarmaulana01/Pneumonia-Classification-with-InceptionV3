# Pneumonia-Classification-with-InceptionV3
This project utilizes the Chest X-Ray Dataset from Kaggle to develop a pneumonia classification system using the InceptionV3 model. We achieved a training accuracy of 94.82% with a loss of 0.1273, and a validation accuracy of 75.00% with a loss of 0.3966. This demonstrates the model's potential for aiding in medical diagnostics.
