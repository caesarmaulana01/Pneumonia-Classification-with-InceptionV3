# Pneumonia Classification System

This project focuses on developing a pneumonia classification system using the Chest X-Ray Dataset from Kaggle. Leveraging the InceptionV3 model, we aimed to accurately identify pneumonia cases from chest X-ray images. 

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Chest X-Ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), which contains X-ray images categorized into pneumonia and normal classes.

## Model
We implemented the InceptionV3 model, a deep learning architecture known for its performance in image classification tasks.

## Results
- **Training Loss:** 0.1273
- **Training Accuracy:** 94.82%
- **Validation Loss:** 0.3966
- **Validation Accuracy:** 75.00%

The high training accuracy indicates that the model is effectively learning to classify the images, while the validation results provide insight into its generalization capabilities.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in medical image classification, paving the way for future applications in healthcare diagnostics. Further optimization and data augmentation strategies could enhance the model's performance on validation data.
